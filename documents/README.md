# SEO overview

I manage SEO at my company, so this lesson was very familiar to me. Over and over again, our SEO results are driven by having content that users are looking for. Our best performing content is about the things that users need to do every day to work with organization, such as filing required paperwork or paying their bill.

It all goes back to talking with the users about whatâ€™s important to them and building a website that is relevant to their needs. You can then validate what you learned from the users by studying analytics and watching their actual behaviors on the site.

# SEO proposal

For my site, I would start with research into commonly searched keyword related to cats, cat pics, and dogs. I would then take that keyword research to determine what content my site can provide that would be of interest to the most users. I would implement those keywords across the site using metadata.

If this was a local business, I would localize the content and use directory listings like Moz Local to help people find the business.

As the site became more established, I would work on a plan for collaborating with other sites and organizations with strong cat content, so we could potentially trade links and help establish the site's authority.
