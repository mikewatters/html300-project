# Proof of concept for stories website

At my workplace, we have a website for telling our customers' stories. When we
put together the website a few years ago, we didn't have many development
resources available, so we hastily threw it together using an existing template
from another part of the website. The template is kind of boring, and it has
some CSS and user experience issues, especially on mobile. There are also some
features we would like to be able to integrate, particularly on pages that
incorporate a video.

For my project, I would like to develop a proof of concept for the website that
demonstrates one way it could be designed. I am inspired by modern storytelling
websites like [The Outline](https://theoutline.com/) for this project, although
the brand requirements of my workplace might require this site to be a bit
cleaner and simpler.

# Website title

The proof of concept website will be called SPIFF stories, which is a play on
the title of the existing website.

# Requirements for each story

Each story on the website includes text and photos, and some incorporate a
photo slideshow or YouTube video. The stories all have a cover image and content
that appears on the homepage.

# API integration

I would like to use [YouTube APIs](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/sample_requests)
to integrate features such as showing related YouTube videos and playlists of
interest to the authenticated user.
